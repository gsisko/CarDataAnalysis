## Usage

For now, please use `start.sh` to start working with the data in a jupyter labs environment. This just sets up your bash environment and starts a jupyter labs server for now. If anyone knows a better way to set up the environment in a jupyter labs or notebook setting PLEASE LET ME KNOW (THIS STUFF DRIVES ME NUTS).
